Use snake_case to define a method, variable or file name. You format snake_case is by using all lower case letters and separating words with the underscore character. For example:

`this_is_a_snake_cased_file.rb`

`forty_two = 42`

`def this_is_a_great_method`

â€‹	`# do stuff`

`end`



A Constant is a variabe that will not change in your program. Use all uppercase letters for constants.

`FOUR = 'four'`

`FIVE = 5` 



When working with `do...end` blocks, prefer `{}` when the entire code fits on one line.

`[1, 2, 3].each { |i| # do stuff }`



Use CamelCase to format a class name

`class MyFirstClass`

`end`

`class MySecondClass`

`end`
